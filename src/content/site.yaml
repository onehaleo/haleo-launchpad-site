# About
about:
  title: "Hey, I'm Alexis ‚Äî the brains behind Haleo."
  intro: "I started Haleo because I was tired of seeing smart, capable solopreneurs stuck in messy ops, half-baked templates, or spending hours on things that should take seconds."
  background: "My background is in automation and cloud architecture ‚Äî building secure systems for big-name federal clients. But I kept thinking: Why don't solo business owners have access to the same tools? Turns out, we do. They just need to be simplified, stripped down, and tailored to you."
  founding: "So I left the red tape and built Haleo ‚Äî an automation studio designed for solopreneurs who want to scale without burning out."
  services:
    - "Build custom automations for things like lead gen, onboarding, invoicing, and internal ops"
    - "Design AI agents that actually understand your workflows"
    - "Create clean, powerful Notion templates (like CRMs and central dashboards)"
    - "Offer intensives for strategy, co-builds, or systems cleanup"
  beliefs:
    - "Simpler is better"
    - "You don't need a team to feel organized"
    - "Systems should save you time, not create more work"
    - "Automation should feel like magic ‚Äî even if it's boring under the hood"
  mission: "Whether you're buying a plug-and-play template or booking a full custom build, my goal is the same: Help you get more done with less effort ‚Äî and finally feel in control of your business backend."
  conclusion: "Let's build a business that runs beautifully behind the scenes."
